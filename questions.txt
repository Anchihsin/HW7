- What is voltage?
A measure of potential energy per unit charge of electrons, or something a physicist would call specific potential energy. 

-What is resistance?
This opposition to electric current. It depends on the type of material, its cross-sectional area, and its temperature. 



-Is a short circuit an example of a closed or open circuit?

Closed.


-How can you determine if a cricuit is closed or open?
An open circuit is one where the continuity has been broken by an interruption in the path for electrons to flow; a closed circuit is one that is complete, with good continuity throughout.
